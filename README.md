# WinOSvulnerability
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<b>Windows is the most predominant operating system in today's world because of its easy-to-use GUI
accessibility. About 85% of the market share has become a critical OS to attack. Furthermore, most
organizations use Active Directory to set up their Windows domain networks. Microsoft employs NTLM
(New Technology LAN Manager) & Kerberos for authentication services. Despite known vulnerabilities,
NTLM remains widely deployed even on new systems to maintain compatibility with legacy clients and
servers.<br>
This lab focuses on how a File Inclusion vulnerability on a webpage being served on a windows machine can
be exploited to collect the NetNTLMv2 challenge of the user that is running the web server. We will use a
utility called Responder to capture a NetNTLMv2 hash and later use a utility known as john the ripper
to test millions of potential passwords to see if they match the one used to create the hash. We will also be
taking a deeper look at the working process of NTLM authentication and how the Responder utility captures
the challenge. We believe that it's crucial to understand the under the hood workings of a tool or a
framework as it strengthens the foundation of one's understanding, which aids in the real world exploit
scenarios that one might face, which do not appear to be vulnerable at the first look. Let's dive straight into
it.</b>
